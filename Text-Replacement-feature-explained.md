For an intro to configuration [read this](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf/wiki/How-to-configure-tgcf-%3F) page.

Inside your configuration under the plugins section put this:

```yaml
  replace:
    text:
      god: devil
      smart: idiot
```

In the above example, "god" will be replaced by "devil" and "smart" will be replaced by "idiot".
