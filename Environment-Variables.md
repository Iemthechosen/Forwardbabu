The secret credentials like `API_ID` and `API_HASH` are stored as environment variables.

You can easily set environment variables for `tgcf` using a `.env` file in the directory from which `tgcf` is invoked.

```shell
API_ID=543213
API_HASH=uihfuiwruiw28490238huawfiuhf
# put your real values here
```
