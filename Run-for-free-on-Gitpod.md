Gitpod is a cloud IDE used for rapid development.

If you are planning to use `tgcf`, then one way is to install it on your computer. The other way is to run it in a cloud environment. Gitpod is the easiest way to go.

1. Click this button, to open a fresh workspace in Gitpod

2. Don't worry about the huge no. of source code files in the IDE. If you are not a developer, then leave them alone.

3. Create two new files `.env` and `tgcf.config.yml` and fill them up.

4. Open the terminal, and activate the `poetry shell`

   ```shell
     poetry shell
   ```
5. Now, `tgcf` is ready to use.
   ```shell
      tgcf --help
      # prints the cli usage
     ```
