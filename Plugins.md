## Official Plugins

The official plugins are installed by default when you install `tgcf`. The source code of these plugins lies under the [`plugins` ](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf/tree/main/tgcf/plugins) subpackage of `tgcf`.

Some of the plugins may have additional non-python dependencies, which you need to manually install.
