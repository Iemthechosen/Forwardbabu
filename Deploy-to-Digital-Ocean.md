DigitalOcean infrastructure is a leading cloud service provider based in the United States of America. Their headquarter operates from New York City, and their data centers are prevalent in every corner of the world in order to provide seamless cloud services across the globe.


## App Platform

You can deploy `tgcf` to the Digital Ocean app platform with the click of a button. The app will be built from the Dockerfile defined at the root of the project.

You can set the environment variables while deploying, from a nice GUI that Digital Ocean offers. You can always edit them later from the control panel. You can even run a console in the app environment to perform other tasks.


## Ubuntu Droplet

If you want more control, you may run `tgcf` on a VPS like Digital Ocean's ubuntu droplets.

Steps:
- Create a Droplet
- SSH into it
- Update packages
- Install python
- Install `tgcf`
- Use `tgcf` CLI
